No, except for a small clutch purse or a clear tote with a maximum size of 12\" Wide x 12\" High x 6\" Deep. \u00bbLawn Chairs? Chair rentals are available for $5! Pick them up when you arrive and then leave them where they are when you leave. Fast, simple and hassle-free! (If you wish to bring your own lawn chair, please be aware that they MUST adhere to the size limitation policy and you will have a thorough search at a specific location that will make entry in the venue slower.) \u00bbBlankets? If you have a lawn seating ticket, yes. \u00bbFood & Drink? No, except for one factory-sealed bottle of water, 20 oz. or less, per person \u00bbRefillable Water Bottles? Yes, but only completely empty. There are fill stations inside. \u00bbCoolers? No. \u00bbWeapons? No. \u00bbCameras? Yes but only non-professional without a detachable lens. \u00bbIPads?

Lawn Seating The lawn seating is a general admission area behind the reserved pavilion seats. It is not covered and therefore, is exposed to the elements. In the event of inclement weather, we recommend quality rain gear. Umbrellas are allowed but may not be open during the performances. Smoking is prohibited except in one section to the far right of the lawn. If you have trouble walking up inclined surfaces, lawn seating may not be the best option for you. If lawn seating is your only option, please see our staff for assistance. Traffic Please plan ahead and allow for plenty of extra time in the event of heavy traffic so that you do not miss any of the earlier performances. We open the parking lots hours early to accommodate all those that want to arrive early. Drop-Offs & Pick-Ups Please arrive before the rush on both ends of a pick-up and drop-off and do so at the Main Entrance off of Route 11B in Gilford -- 72 Meadowbrook Ln. Tailgating We have several parking areas and we condone and even, promote, responsible tailgating. Tailgating can be a very big part of making the event fun and memorable for you. That being said, the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, in our parking areas, actually violates a local Gilford ordinance. Underage drinking and/or intoxication, will most certainly cause you to miss the show and may lead to being arrested. Weather All performances will go on rain or shine. In the event of a weather emergency, like a hurricane, events will most likely be rescheduled. In the event of inclement weather, please use quality rain gear. Umbrellas are allowed but may not be open during performances. Umbrellas Umbrellas are allowed inside the venue and we allow all types of chairs and blankets in the lawn area. We ask that you are courteous and keep your umbrella closed during the performance to not obstruct anyone's view. We recommend wearing ponchos or other rain gear. The show will go on rain or shine. Weapons There are absolutely no weapons of any kind permitted into the venue including small pocket knives. There will be bag searches and pat downs. Any weapons discovered on an individual attempting to enter the venue will be confiscated and we will not be able to return that item to you at any time. Pets There are no pets allowed anywhere on the property. Please contact the box office in advance to coordinate the use of any kind of service animal. No Re-entry Once you enter the pavilion, you will not be permitted to leave the venue and re-enter again so please be sure to bring everything you need with you the first time. Be sure to have your photo ID with you as everyone is carded for alcohol service. Doors The doors or gates to our midway typically open between 90 and 120 minutes prior to the main stage performances starting. We usually have a lot going on include excellent regional acts playing on the Magic Hat Stage so please come in early, enjoy everything we have to offer and assure your party not missing any of the show all at the same time. Resale Tickets When the artist approves to do so, we offer our customers the ability to buy and sell tickets directly from each other for their convenience, comfort and security. For more information on our resell program, go here. Ticket Information There are no refunds or exchanges on any tickets for any event.
